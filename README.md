## What I had gained from the talk : 
Through the NALI 2023 program, I had gained my focused on the Technopreneurship Course's Systematic Problem-Solving Process utilizing Computational Thinking. 
I am aware of the applications of computational thinking in the technology sector. With its origins in computer science, computational thinking is a problem-solving methodology that emphasizes decomposition, pattern recognitions, abstraction, algorithms, and systematic problem-solving.
For example, Computational Thinking ideation process using Canva. I also study how Canva's ideas becomes a model business via the use of business ideation techniques. 
Conclusion, I learned a lot about the information computational thinking skills for computer science students from this program. 
I want to be able to use this knowledge to my advantage while I study computer science and for the future.

## Improvement : 
From this activity, the only way where this activity has to be improved is by offering templates to students,
which will provide them ideas for reflection and project reporting.

## Others : 
The NALI program emphasizing entrepreneurial academia which aims to equip students with soft skills and design thinking that necessary for our future careers. 
This including creativity, adaptability and a proactive approach to problem-solving.
